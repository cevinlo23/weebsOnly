## Introduction

So far we've built 2 Angular apps that consumed 3rd party APIs (Astronaunt and Weather API apps). Your lab prompt is an open-ended one: in pairs, make something cool using a 3rd party API of your choosing!

Choose one associate to fork and clone this repo. Create your project folder structure inside. Add both associate's names in the title of the pull request.

## APIs you may (but don't have to) use...

* [Capital One Hackathon API](http://api.reimaginebanking.com/)
* [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/)
* [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/)
* [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api)
* [TV Maze](http://www.tvmaze.com/api)
* [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
There's an API for pretty much everything. You can search for more at [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/explore) or [check out these public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)

**If you find yourself spending more than 10 minutes just getting the API to talk back to you via Postman or the browser, you're spending too much time.** Ping an instructor if you need any API suggestions.

## MVP - Minimum Viable Product

Your API app must have at minimum:

1. A component with a form to accept user input
2. Create a service to make the API call
3. Render the results to the view

## BONUS

Add routing to a 2nd API.
